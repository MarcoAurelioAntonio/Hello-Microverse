# Descrption

In this project, you will set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding is required for this exercise. Your goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices you learned about in previous steps. You will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in your future job as well, so it is important to know them!

## General requirements

- Make sure that there are no linter errors.
- Make sure that you used correct (GitHub flow).
- Make sure that you documented your work.

## Waiting for the review code.
## I hope i have luck (if that is ok)
